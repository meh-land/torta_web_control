# Torta Web Control

This repo contains all the ROS code that is meant to be used in conjunction with the web GUI

## How to use

1. Create a ROS workspace

2. Create a ROS package and name it `torta_web_control`, the name is not relevant to the scripts themselves but web GUI expects the package to have this exact name (case sensitive)

3. Clone this repo in your newly created package. Note that the files here will replace some of the ROS auto-generated files.

4. cd to your workspace and run `catkin_make`
